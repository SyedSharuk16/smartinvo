Smartinvo is am app created by me to help grocery store owners predict their stocks's spoilage.
it involves large collection of data and machine learning algoriths to predict the most spoiled items correlating with the user's stock while also influencing weather condition.

The app is backboned by python using gradientboostregressors for training model and exhibiting it via react using cross origin resource sharing.

## Model insights

The `/model_info` API now surfaces both the model's top predicted waste items and the commodities with the highest historical losses, helping users verify findings like the high spoilage risk of watermelons.
